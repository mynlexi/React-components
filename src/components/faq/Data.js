          question : "Is hypnosis real?",
          answer : " The results - habit change, emotional resolution, greater effectiveness, etc - are undoubtably real, so hypnosis is just one way of using words to get real results."

        {
          question : "Can I be hypnotized?",
          answer : "Yes, because all humans go in and out of trance many times per day. And these days I more often use conversational hypnosis, where we have a 'normal' conversation and the desired changes happen."

        {
